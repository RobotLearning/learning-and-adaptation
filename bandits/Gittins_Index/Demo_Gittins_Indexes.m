% Gittins Index Computation Demo
% ==============================
%
% Demonstrate the use of the index computation algorithms.
%
% The same indexes are computed using:
%
% - the largest-index-first algorithm of Varaiya et al.
% - the restart-state formulation of Katehakis el al.
% - the elimination algorithm of Sonin
%
% The results differ for a factor (1-Discount) because of
% the difference in the characterizations given by Gittins
% and Whittle.
%
% All remaining differences are due to rounding errors.
%
% The differences between the Varaiya and the Katehakis
% algorithms, in the Gittins' characterization, are reported
% in the matrix C_vk.
%
% The differences between the Katehakis and the Sonin
% algorithms, in the Whittle characterization, are reported
% in the matrix C_ks.
%
% The differences between the Sonin and the Varaiya
% algorithms, in the Gittins' characterization, are reported
% in the matrix C_sv.
