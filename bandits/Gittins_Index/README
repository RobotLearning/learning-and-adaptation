
Here you can find straightforward implementations of some algorithms to
calculate the Gittins index for Markov chains with rewards on the states.

The algorithms run in Matlab and Octave.  You can see one demonstration in:

            Demo_Gittins_Indexes.m

Just run it, it will generate a number of random models and report the
differences between the outcomes of the algorithms in three different matrices.
These differences should be merely rounding errors.

but please consider that, depending on my workload, I might not manage to find
time to reply.
