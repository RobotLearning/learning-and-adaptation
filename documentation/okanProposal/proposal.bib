abstract={Humans can use the Internet to share knowledge and to help each other accomplish complex tasks. Until now, robots have not taken advantage of this opportunity. Sharing knowledge between robots requires methods to effectively encode, exchange, and reuse data. In this article, we present the design and first implementation of a system for sharing knowledge between robots.},
