\begin{figure}[hbt!]%--- Picture 'H'ere, 'B'ottom or 'T'op; '!' Try to
                    %impose your will to LaTeX
  \epsfCfile{.85}{geys-2kern} %<< no file extension
  %%         --- .85 stands for 85% of text width
  \caption[Geyser data: binned histogram, Silverman's and another
  kernel]%<<-- Legend for the list of figures at the beginning of you thesis
  {Old Faithful Geyser eruption lengths, $n=272$; binned data and two
    (Gaussian) kernel density estimates ($\times 10$) with $h=h^*= .3348$
    and $h= .1$ (dotted).}% legend displayed below the graph.

Or also with \texttt{includegraphics}:
\begin{figure}[hbt!]%--- Picture 'H'ere, 'B'ottom or 'T'op; '!' Try to
                    %impose your will to LaTeX
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{geys-2kern} %<< no file extension
  %%         --- .5\textwidth stands for 50% of text width
  \caption[Geyser data: binned histogram, Silverman's and another
  kernel]%<<-- Legend for the list of figures at the beginning of you thesis
  {Old Faithful Geyser eruption lengths, $n=272$; binned data and two
    (Gaussian) kernel density estimates ($\times 10$) with $h=h^*= .3348$
    and $h= .1$ (dotted).}% legend displayed below the graph.
  \label{fig:geys2}
\end{figure}

\section{Other information}
Put a text between quotes: make sure to use nice quotes, such as ``quote''.

Cite a document in the bibliography (an example here): \cite{Reference}.
%%--> in file   myReferences.bib  (same directory)
Or mention that \citeauthor{HamF85} (a person) or \citeauthor{StaWW91} (two
persons) have already done quite a bit work.
